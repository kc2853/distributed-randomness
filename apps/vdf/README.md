# Vdf

A simple Commit-Reveal + VDF scheme which collects random shares from each node and slows it down by passing it through a delay function. This prevents the last node from predicting the output (last revealer attack). Wesolowskiâ€™s succinct argument is used to prove the correctness of the output.
